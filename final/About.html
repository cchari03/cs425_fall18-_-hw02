                    <p> A short Bio of Mr.John Doe:
                </div>
                <div id="Title4"><br>Mr.John Doe is a photographic artist who specialises in evocative<br> images of
                    the living world. Born in Cyprus in 1976.<br>In 1992 he co-founded one of Londonâ€™s leading
                    photographic <br>special effects companies. With the use of pioneering digital<br> techniques, he
                    quickly built up a world-wide client base and worked on <br>many prestigious campaigns,including
                    the official posters for the <br>1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
                    <br> Within a short time he had swapped his established city career for the<br> precarious life of
                    an international travelling photographer. <br>His photographs reveal a compassionate understanding
                    <br>of his subjects

                    He has won international <br>awards for his work, including The Power of Photography Award, <br>The
                    Golden Eye of Russia, and Lucie Awards.
