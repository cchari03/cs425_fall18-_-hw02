Born in Cyprus in 1976.<br>In 1992 he co-founded one of Londonâ€™s leading photographic <br>special effects companies.

                        <br>   Within a short time he had swapped his established city career for the<br> precarious life of an international travelling photographer. <br>His photographs reveal a compassionate understanding <br>of his subjects
                           
                        He has won international <br>awards for his work, including The Power of Photography Award, <br>The Golden Eye of Russia, and Lucie Awards.
